A .NET-based IoT solution featuring a HeadEnd core module, built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Clean Architecture, and a Modular Monolith approach.


# IoT HeadEnd Solution

This repository contains a **full .NET solution** developed for an **IoT-based application**.  
The central component of the system is the **HeadEnd module**, which serves as the primary entry point for IoT device communication, data processing, and integration with other subsystems.

## 🏗 Architectural Approach
The solution is designed with modern software architecture best practices to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clarity in domain logic:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** – Rich domain model with clear boundaries, domain events, and value objects.
- **Clean Architecture** – Separation of concerns between core domain logic, application services, and infrastructure.
- **Modular Monolith** – Organized into well-defined modules for easier development, testing, and potential future decomposition into microservices.

## 📌 Key Features
- Centralized HeadEnd for managing IoT devices and data.
- Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure layers.
- Extensible design to integrate with future IoT modules or external services.
- Built with **.NET** for enterprise-grade performance and maintainability.

## 🛠 Technologies & Libraries
This solution uses the following technologies and libraries:

- **.NET 9** – Core development framework  
- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)** – ORM for data access and migrations  
- **Dapper** – Lightweight micro-ORM for high-performance queries  
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database backend  
- **MediatR** – In-process messaging for CQRS and decoupled communication  
- **FluentValidation** – Strongly-typed, fluent model validation  
- **.NET Aspire Dashboard** – Observability and monitoring for distributed applications
