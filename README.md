# sergin
A .NET-based IoT solution featuring a HeadEnd core module, built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Clean Architecture, and a Modular Monolith approach.


# IoT HeadEnd Solution

This repository contains a **full .NET solution** developed for an **IoT-based application**.  
The central component of the system is the **HeadEnd module**, which serves as the primary entry point for IoT device communication, data processing, and integration with other subsystems.

## üèó Architectural Approach
The solution is designed with modern software architecture best practices to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clarity in domain logic:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** ‚Äì Rich domain model with clear boundaries, domain events, and value objects.
- **Clean Architecture** ‚Äì Separation of concerns between core domain logic, application services, and infrastructure.
- **Modular Monolith** ‚Äì Organized into well-defined modules for easier development, testing, and potential future decomposition into microservices.
